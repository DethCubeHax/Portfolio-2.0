        "description": "Recognizing the importance of underwater communication between the control stations and the robots, I, alongside two other engineers developed a stable and robust communication system on a low budget. This paper presents our prototyping, methodology and the performance of the system\n\nThe controller comprises of a drop-in, easy to build PCB designed using EasyEDA, with 2 joysticks, 1 potentiometer and 2 push buttons that can be mapped to any control for a range of underwater robots."
