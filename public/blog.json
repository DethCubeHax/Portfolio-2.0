Every single color palette, layout and design choice was made by me, every animation, effect and JavaScript written from scratch.\nOf course I encountered tons of bugs along the way, especially with as complex of a dynamic background, transitions and various effects as shown here, but every single time, my initial frustration and head-bashing was quickly replaced with a surge of elation. And it just kept getting better and better as page after page, I knew I was approaching the day.\nThat day is today. DethCubeHax, signing out."

Having said that though, this console will now allow visitors to ask questions about me or navigating the site, as well as some other additions for the interested to find out ;). \n It features some really cool stuff, such as my age in years, correct to 10 decimal places since my birthday, as well as counts of my projects, work-experiences, publications and the like. Naturally having such *infinite* time at my disposal, of course I made the wise decision of hardcoding these counts for the time being because I do not hav the time, nor the energy to pull off a dynamic system to do this.\nIf only there was an easier way to impress the hiring team... As they say, life could be a dream, but it is not.\n DethCubeHax, signing out."

        "content": "Amidst the whirlwind of university life and the constant juggle of assignments, I somehow managed to land an internship at Standard Chartered Bank in their SME Banking division! ðŸŽ‰ Talk about a plot twist in my academic saga.\n\nFrom day one, it's been a rollercoaster of learning, challenges, and yes, a fair share of coffee-fueled late nights. Who knew the world of SME banking could be so intricate? Certainly not my pre-intern self, who thought 'requirements engineering' was just a fancy word for a task that is trivial at best.\n\nOne of the highlights? Getting to work on real projects that actually impact real businesses. It's both exhilarating and slightly terrifying. There I was, a student who still occasionally burns PCBs on a regular basis, helping craft strategies that could influence the financial health of small and medium enterprises. Talk about imposter syndrome on steroids!\n\nOf course, no internship would be complete without its fair share of Excel spreadsheets. I swear, by the end of this, I'll be able to pivot table in my sleep. Who needs party tricks when you can impress people with your VLOOKUP skills, right?\n\nBut jokes aside, this experience has been eye-opening. It's one thing to learn about banking in textbooks, and a whole other ball game to see it in action. The teamwork, the problem-solving, the way everyone comes together to support our SME clients â€“ it's pretty inspiring stuff.\n\nAs I plough through and sponge up the experiences in this internship and head to my final year, I can't help but feel a mix of gratitude and excitement. Grateful for the opportunity and the amazing mentors I have, and excited for what's next. Who knows, SCB will hire me after graduation... or maybe I'll start my own SME and become a client instead. The plot thickens!\n\nDethCubeHax, signing out (and off to practice my firm handshake for future networking events)."

        "content": "Hello, tech enthusiasts and fellow developers!\n\nToday, I'm thrilled to share my latest project: implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot using Ollama and local embeddings, hosting it on a FastAPI server, and making it accessible via my website's terminal using Telebit. This journey has been a blend of intense coding, problem-solving, and a lot of learning. Let's dive into the details!\n\nStep 1: Setting Up Ollama and Local Embeddings\n\nThe first step was to integrate Ollama, a powerful AI model, with local embeddings. This combination allows the chatbot to retrieve relevant information efficiently and generate accurate responses.\n\nStep 2: Hosting on FastAPI\n\nNext, I needed a robust and scalable server to host the chatbot. FastAPI was the perfect choice due to its speed and ease of use.\n\nStep 3: Exposing the API with Telebit\n\nTo make the API accessible over the internet, I used Telebit, a tool that provides secure tunnels to localhost.\n\nStep 4: Connecting to the Website Terminal\n\nFinally, I integrated the chatbot with my website's terminal. This involved some JavaScript to handle user inputs and display responses.\n\nAnd there you have it! A fully functional RAG AI chatbot integrated into my website's terminal. This project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I hope it inspires you to explore the exciting world of AI and web development.\n\nUntil next time, happy coding!\n\nDethCubeHax, signing out."
