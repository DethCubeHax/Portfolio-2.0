      "In 3 months, I worked as a Student Research Assistant to develop a digital twin of the Innovation Wing compound at HKU, with interactable VR objects.",
      "The 3D model was developed from scratch using the CAD model of the Innovation Wing with the textures applied.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the twin was used to co-host the 7th Engineering Innoshow to allow guests to attend the event online, garnering over 4000 visitors.",
      "Finally, I was honoured with the opportunity to teach a group of students across various faculties on how to create similar 3D models and deploy their own game in Unity."
