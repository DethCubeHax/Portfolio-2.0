      "I have been developing a software stack using language models (LLMs) to convert generic user textual input into robot arm motor commands. This allows a user to control a robot arm through natural language interactions.",
      "Initially, I evaluated camera information from an Intel RealSense D435 depth camera to obtain the transformation between the camera frame and my robot's base frame.",
      "Currently, I am leading an investigation into suitable text-to-image object classification and language models.",
      "At the same time, I am directing development of a ROS MoveIt simulation environment. This will allow testing and refining the system's motion planning."
