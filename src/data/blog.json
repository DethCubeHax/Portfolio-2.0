Every single color palette, layout and design choice was made by me, every animation, effect and JavaScript written from scratch.\nOf course I encountered tons of bugs along the way, especially with as complex of a dynamic background, transitions and various effects as shown here, but every single time, my initial frustration and head-bashing was quickly replaced with a surge of elation. And it just kept getting better and better as page after page, I knew I was approaching the day.\nThat day is today. DethCubeHax, signing out."

        "content": "Having way too much 'free' time than I should for a penultimate university student with his finals approaching, I decided to add a fancy new Terminal to the mix, and totally did NOT do this by hand ðŸ’€... Having said that though, this console will now allow visitors to ask questions about me or navigating the site, as well as some other additions for the interested to find out ;). \n It features some really cool stuff, such as my age in years, correct to 10 decimal places since my birthday, as well as counts of my projects, work-experiences, publications and the like. Naturally having such *infinite* time at my disposal, of course I made the wise decision of hardcoding these counts for the time being because I do not hav the time, nor the energy to pull off a dynamic system to do this.\nIf only there was an easier way to impress the hiring team... As they say, life could be a dream, but it is not.\n DethCubeHax, signing out."
