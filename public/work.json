This interface could detect and draw bounding boxes around vehicles and pedestrians, and allowed the user to add collision detectors of any shape or form to detect if an object passed through it.",

        "Finally, I was honoured with the opportunity to teach a group of students across various faculties on how to create similar 3D models and deploy their own game in Unity."
